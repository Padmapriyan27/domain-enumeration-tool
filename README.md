# 0xD4rkEYe Domain Enumeration Tool

## Beta v0.3

### Overview

The **Domain Enumeration Tool** is a unix-only  Python-based utility designed to perform an in-depth analysis of a target domain. This tool gathers a variety of information including DNS records, WHOIS data, IP information, geolocation data, SSL certificate details, HTTP headers, Nmap scan results, subdomains, and more. It is an essential resource for security researchers, penetration testers, and anyone looking to perform a comprehensive analysis of domain assets.

### Features

- **DNS Records**: Retrieves multiple DNS record types, such as A, MX, TXT, CNAME, SRV, etc.
- **WHOIS Information**: Fetches detailed WHOIS data for the domain, including registrar and contact information.
- **IP Information**: Resolves the domain to its IP address, conducts reverse DNS lookups, and provides geolocation data.
- **Geolocation**: Identifies the physical location of the domainâ€™s IP address
- **SSL Certificate**: Extracts detailed SSL certificate information for domains with HTTPS, including issuer, validity dates, and more.
- **HTTP Headers**: Retrieves and displays HTTP headers from the domain.
- **Nmap Scan**: Performs an Nmap scan to detect open ports and services associated with the domain.
- **Subdomain Discovery**: Finds subdomains using domain-based queries and certificate transparency logs.
- **Emails Extraction**: Finds email addresses associated with the domain by scraping WHOIS and DNS data.
- **Zone Transfer Test**: Verifies if a DNS zone transfer is allowed.
- **DNSSEC Check**: Checks the status of DNSSEC for the domain.
- **Robots.txt Scraping**: Fetches the robots.txt file to determine any rules regarding search engine crawling.
